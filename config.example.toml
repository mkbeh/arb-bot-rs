# Asset list: Base assets for arbitrage chains.
# IMPORTANT: 'symbol' must be a REAL trading pair on the SELECTED exchange (e.g., binance).
# - Exact match required: full name as in API (case-sensitive, e.g., "BTCUSDT", "USDTTRY").
# - For Binance: Check https://api.binance.com/api/v3/exchangeInfo.
# - For KuCoin: Check https://api.kucoin.com/api/v1/symbols.
# - If invalid: Bot won't fetch tickers, chains will fail.
# - symbol: Required for crypto/fiat; None for stables (uses defaults).
# - qty limits: 0 = use global defaults from settings; overrides per asset.
